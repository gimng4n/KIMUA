DESCRIPTION: The Once Upon an Arduino Project is a physical and interactive model that retells a classic tale/story. This project has layers of concept design, enclosure design, affordance, coding, and wiring management. We did a take on the LEGO Indiana Jones game, highlighting the scene where Indiana Jones finds and retrieves the Golden Idol artifact in a ancient temple and attempts to escape the deadly traps. Implementing four servos, one automata, and two LEDs to replicate deadly trap interactions and signifiers.

INPUTS: 4 copper sensors
OUTPUTS: 4 servos, 2 LEDs
